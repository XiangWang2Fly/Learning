6
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,326
Gilmore.

9
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,251
Corn Syrup Droughts, 
Bandwidth Riots

11
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,747
outlive them

12
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,541
make it

14
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:47,101
Columbus is the 
fastest-growing city on Earth.

15
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:51,441
Halliday and Morrow 
started Gregarious Games.

16
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,709
bummer

22
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,055
when you're running on
an omnidirectional treadmill

23
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,400
with quadraphonic,
pressure-sensitive underlay.

34
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,724
Surf a 50-foot monster wave
in Hawaii.

35
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:13,617
ski 
down the pyramids.

36
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,520
Mount Everest

38
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,356
Check out this place.
It's a casino the size of a planet.

41
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,270
go in there

45
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:46,045
a different species,
live-action

46
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,654
It's all your call.

48
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,961
feel like 
changing it.

56
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,649
Sector 12. Planet Doom.

58
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:26,089
and a pretty great place
to pick up coin.

59
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,692
Figures Aech would be there.

61
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,435
He's my best friend, period.

63
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,506
- What's up?
- Hey, what up, Z?

64
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,951
Next race is in 20 minutes,
and I can't do the late one.

65
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:49,647
What the hell are you up to?

66
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,289
Man, gettin' my kills on, bro.

67
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,515
Daito?

68
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,119
Sho.

69
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,410
This an artifact hunt?

70
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,295
Yup. Gregarious 120.

71
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,868
Turn into any giant robot
for two minutes. That's rad.

74
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,011
made sure
the OASIS was littered

75
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:19,709
with enough
randomly powerful stuff

76
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:24,082
that anyone could win
if they had the skills.

77
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,923
Death matches and artifact hunts
are a good way to coin-snatch,

85
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,666
Everything you've
ever worked for.

92
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,900
10 minutes
until the race starts.

94
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,234
brainchild

97
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:29,051
out of the picture

100
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,492
worshiped him

103
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,130
If you all wanna reach
under your seats,

105
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,668
But we're gonna... we're each
gonna bring you one now.

108
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,923
And what he left behind

112
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:36,281
Before I died, I created what we
in the biz call an "Easter egg."


115
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,831
I've hidden somewhere
inside the OASIS

116
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:54,466
will inherit my stock
in Gregarious Games,

117
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,337
currently valued in excess
of half a million do...

118
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,337
Uh, half a trillion
dollars' worth,

20
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:13,523
Anorak the All-Knowing,


122
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,559
test for worthy traits

123
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,813
revealing three hidden keys
to three magic gates.

124
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,067
And those with the skill
to survive these straits

125
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,868
will reach the end,
where the prize awaits.

126
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,443
Off you go, keys.

127
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:43,721
The keys aren't just laying
around under a rock somewhere.

128
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:46,446
I suppose you could say
they're invisible,

129
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,192
hidden in a dark room
that's at the center of a maze


132
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,629
Let the hunt
for Easter egg

133
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,543
begin.

134
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,209
The challenge
is to find three keys,

135
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,810
but in five years,
no one has even gotten one key.

136
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,816
And the big scoreboard?

137
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,747
Some long-forgotten gunter
cracked the first clue

138
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,036
and found the first challenge.

139
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:24,321
Then, this portal appeared.

141
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,760
that was so hard,
no one had ever finished it.

142
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,273
The only ones still trying are the gunters,
as in "egg hunters,"

144
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,637
the Sixers.

145
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,811
IOI...

147
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,144
...Innovative
Online Industries.

148
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,605
They're the second-largest
company in the world

149
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,848
with designs
on becoming the first.

150
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,819
Which is why they're putting
everything they got

151
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,147
into winning contest.

152
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,852
Buckle up!

153
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,856
Sit in!

154
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,527
We call 'em "Sixers"
'cause that's the company rule.

155
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:03,795
No name, just numbers.

156
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,626
They have a support team
made up of scholars.

157
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,342
Like me, they spend all their
time studying pop culture

158
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:10,995
was obsessed with,

159
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,013
trying to find clues
to solve the contest.

160
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,538
They're just following
the orders of the head of IOI,

161
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,684
this dickweed
named Nolan Sorrento.

162
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,287
How'd you get here before me?

163
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,718
Well, I didn't make a pit stop
at the hair salon.

164
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,234
- What up, Z?
- What's up?

165
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,526
Saved you a spot.

168
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,295
Ugh. So you can skim coins
from crashed cars?

170
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,884
Oh, but you still had enough to pay
for that Something About Mary hairdo.

173
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,011
are you seeing this?

174
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,183
Yeah, I see it.
That's Kaneda's bike from Akira.

175
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:35,409
It's a licensed skin
over a standard frame.

176
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,768
No, not the bike.
Forget the bike.

177
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,093
The girl,
I think it's Art3mis.

178
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:42,419
The Sixer Fixer?

179
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,361
I've seen all her walk-throughs,
her Twitch streams.

180
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:47,327
It's her. It's definitely her.

182
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,438
You got it, you got it!

183
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,315
Balls.

184
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,029
She's not gonna make it.

185
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,602
Bail! Bail out!

186
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:06,667
Bail!


192
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,289
Where did you find
an Iron Giant?

193
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,213
- Find it? I'm building it.
- That's a commission.

194
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:15,093
Oh, yeah.
is top-rated on the mod boards.

196
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,340
Oh, hey, check this out!

197
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:23,339
Hey. Z, yo.

198
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,812
- The Galactica, of course.
- These are my babies, all right, man?

199
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:27,578
Sulaco, from Aliens.

200
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,179
Dude, how are you
showing off my shit?

201
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,752
Valley Forge, from Silent Running.
Oh, where's the Harkonnen Drop-Ship?

202
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:34,318
That thing is sick.
Folds space like a boss.

203
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,389
I mean, you can get from Incipio
to Arrakis in three seconds...

204
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,156
Fingers!

205
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,587
You'll have to excuse him.

206
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,731
He gets a little nervous
around pretty girls.


208
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,271
Yup. He's pretty great.

209
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,344
I assume you and Shoulder
Blades are clanned up.

210
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,611
Nah.

212
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,286
Oh, 'cause you're Parzival,

213
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,857
as in the knight who found
the Holy Grail by himself.

215
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,858
Goddess of the hunt.
Clans must be killing to sign you up.

218
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,934
GoldenEye.

219
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,295
- Playing as?
- Oddjob

220
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,038
Favorite game variant?

221
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,639
Game variant was "slappers only."

222
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,624
I know what "slappers only" means.
Racer?

223
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,609
Turbo. And his favorite food
was Hot Pockets.

224
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,579
Favorite restaurant
was Chuck E Cheese.

225
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,920
Song was Video Killed the
Radio Star by the Buggles.

226
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:38,815
Video Take on Me by A-ha.

229
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,590
"come away thinking"

230
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,063
"ingredients on the back of a chewing-gum wrapper

232
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,572
Lex Luthor.

235
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,276
Oh! I mean,
I've got tons of plans in the real world.

237
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,986
Now I know
why you stopped short.

238
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,157
No one ever makes it past Kong.

240
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,755
Well, then you know it can't be true.
hated making rules.

242
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,297
- No, I'm not!

245
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,599
takes over the world.
249
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,329
There you go. 

250
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,546
Thanks for the fix-up, my man.

252
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,370
I'll wave to you
from the finish line, McFly.

254
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,905
Captain Big Mouth.

255
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,337
Where the hell are my gloves?

256
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,384
Shit. I gotta go.

257
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,416
ANNOUNCE X1.

258
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,388
When I'm after gold on Planet Doom,
I need every edge I can get.

260
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:30,655
Get ready for the feel,
the feel of real. X1.

261
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,002
The X1 is like wearing
a second skin.

262
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,998
A skin that kicks ass.

263
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,612
I zeroed out 'cause
of your broke-ass gloves.

267
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:50,121
Why don't you just respawn and
level up like everyone else?

269
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,524
I bought all these power-ups for
this challenge, and I lost it all.

270
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,389
That artifact
was gonna pay for the house!

271
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,055
Wait.

272
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:02,056
How much of our house money
did you spend on upgrades?

273
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,930
Well, all of it,
but I was gonna win.

274
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,870
That was our ticket
out of here.

275
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,965
You idiot.

276
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,970
No, but I only lost 'cause
of the bad gloves.

277
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,706
Our house! Our goddamn house!

278
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,441
My boys
were in that challenge.

279
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,752
You couldn't have beat them
in a bootsuit, you noob.

282
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,876
No, we are not
calling the cops.

283
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,988
Go to your room, Rick.

284
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:30,087
Aw, come on, Alice.

285
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:34,088
Why do you put up with this guy?
He's a shitshow.

286
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:38,662
I ought to kick the both of you out.
I swear to G-O-D, Wade Watts,

287
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,434
if I catch you
touching my stuff again,

290
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,005
My dad picked that name

291
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,253
alter ego,

292
00:21:57,254 --> 00:22:00,919
like Peter Parker
or Bruce Banner.

293
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,987
But he died when I was a kid.

294
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,188
My mom, too,
and I ended up here,

295
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,091
living with Aunt Alice

296
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,533
and her endless string
of hard-loving losers.

298
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,871
Why is that line
sticking in my head?

299
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,713
Maybe it's 'cause,
and she's hot.

300
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:26,977
Maybe it's because
she called me out,

301
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,148
sitting here
in my tiny corner of nowhere,

302
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,878
protecting my small slice
of nothing.

303
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,152
Or maybe...

304
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,663
Maybe it's because
that line means something


306
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,109
The day the contest
was announced,

307
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,059
Journals appeared.

308
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,403
He told us to look in his brain.
This was the next best thing.

309
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:52,744
At first, it was jammed with
gunters looking for answers.

310
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:55,368
Now, the once-crowded halls
of memories

311
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,644
are left to people like me.

312
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:59,410
Oh, joy!

313
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,911
And how will you eat up
my valuable search time today?

314
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,082
Gregarious Games, 2029...
Office party.

315
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,253
Office party.
Yes, you've only seen it a thousand times.


317
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,732
Each entry into Journals is meticulously assembled

318
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:17,226
from personal photographs,
home video recordings,

319
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,159
surveillance, and nanny cams.

320
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:23,000
All rendered into a three-dimensional
virtual experience.

321
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,671
archived

322
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:30,007
located on the mezzanine.

323
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,578
No weapons or mature-themed avatars
are permitted within the Journals.

324
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,378
Please enjoy your time with us,
and happy gunting!

325
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,216
I like cleaning up.

326
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,647
Okay, Jim,
I'm, uh... I'm going.

327
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,527
Everything changes, Jim.
Everything evolves.

328
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,247
Some things are perfect just
the way they arAsteroids.

329
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:56,968
People don't live inside
an Asteroids arcade cabinet.

330
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,137
I know that.

331
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,368
Yeah, well,
people are living inside the arcade we built.

332
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,542
- I built.
- Uh, well...

333
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,253
Right. Well,
I guess you can say whatever you want.

334
00:24:07,254 --> 00:24:08,775
I don't really wanna
talk about it anymore.

335
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,950
No, of course
you don't wanna talk about it.

336
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,378
You're forcing me out.

337
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,917
Closer on.

338
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,788
Look, invention
comes with responsibilities

339
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:16,954
you didn't ask for.

340
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,155
All right,
if you make something people want or need

341
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,957
then it's up to you to set the limits.
You have to make some rules.

343
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,402
I don't wanna make
any more rules.

347
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,839
We created something beautiful,
Jim, but it's changed.

348
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,469
Okay? It's really
not a game anymore.

350
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:41,648
I liked how things were
when they were...

351
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,249
When it was a game.

352
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,020
And we're back to where we started.
But that's the point, isn't it?

353
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,519
Things move forward
whether you like it or not.


355
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:54,357
Fine.

356
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:00,368
Why can't we go backwards,
for once?


358
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,972
Really put the pedal to the metal,
you know?

360
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:16,306
Why can't we go backwards,
for once?

361
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:20,718
Backwards, really fast.
Fast as we can.

362
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,519
Really put the pedal to the metal,
you know?

363
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,323
Bill and Ted did it.


368
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,000
Nice racing, Padawan.


373
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,735
and how the hell is he winning?

374
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,106
Well, here's a better question.
Who cares?

375
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:32,475
contest is vitally important.

376
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,577
I mean, it's nothing less than a
war for control of the future.

377
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,820
He's not even clanned up.

378
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:42,147
He's alone. We have an army.

379
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,893
And yet,
he's got the first key.

382
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,428
Our stock dove 6% yesterday.

383
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,399
profits of 28%. F'Nale.

385
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:00,266
Debt Services dwarfs Hardware.

386
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,341
Now, you really wanna talk
to me about stock prices?

387
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:04,374
The shareholders
won't be happy.



389
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:11,145
but once we launch this little baby,
they're gonna flip.

390
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,617
We call this Pure O2.

391
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,520
This is the first
of our planned upgrades.

392
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,132
Once we can roll back some of 
ad restrictions,

393
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:24,194
we estimate
we can sell up to 80%

394
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:29,595
inducing seizures, so picture this...

395
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,671
All of this implies
we win the contest.

397
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,314
Dude, you won the key
and 100,000 coins?

398
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:43,814
As soon as I took the key,

399
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,715
all the coins
just appeared in my account.

400
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,047
I'll tell you what,
I'm soiling my haptics right now.

401
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,456
What the hell's a Cataclyst?

402
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:57,228
A bomb. Kills every avatar
on a planet, even the owner.

403
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,458
Who'd want that?

405
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,643
Twenty-thou
for the holy hand grenade?

406
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,366
That's a steal!

407
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,480
Whoa! Zemeckis Cube!

409
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,186
X1 haptic bootsuit.

411
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,420
i-R0k

412
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,262
To be honest,
I have kind of a neck thing.

413
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:38,228
It's like a carpel-tunnel deal

414
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,478
but with your neck,
if that's even a thing.

415
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,728
So if you could just stand
to... to your right.

417
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,240
Thanks, it's the repetitive stress.
Oh.

418
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,435
Here he is.

419
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,198
The steampunk pirate king.
I knew him well.

420
00:31:57,199 --> 00:32:00,886
There are only three things
in this world I hate,

421
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:04,855
steampunk, pirates,
and tabbouleh.

422
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,686
I mean,
why do they even have it?

423
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,402
Is there a reason
we're meeting here?

424
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:15,625
The Orb of Osuvox.



426
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,744
It creates an impenetrable magic
shield that can only be taken down

427
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:29,148
by a magic spell.

431
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,920
Now, I'm gonna need you
to keep this for now.

432
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,164
I'm gonna let you know
when I wanna use it.



434
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,671
Right now, though,
I have another job for you.

435
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:51,998
Ah.



438
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,242
Can you do that?

439
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,778
Well, he's a superstar.

440
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,647
He made it
through the first gate

441
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,248
and avatars are gonna be
on him like hoes on Santa.

443
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,117
You never lick.

444
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,164
You bite straight
to the chocolaty center

445
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:17,294
of the Tootsie Pop.

446
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,695
Remember that old commercial,
with the owl?

448
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,500
Three times my normal fee.

449
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,136
Done.

450
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,007
Wait, really?
I should have asked for five.

451
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:30,006
Is four still on the table?

452
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,210
There's five of us
on the big board now.

453
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,015
was next,
no surprise there.

454
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,346
She was on the track when I won.
She saw me going backwards.

455
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:46,392
a tip, made him promise not
to say anything, and then he won next.

456
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:49,061
I'm pretty sure
he bragged to our pal,

457
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:51,795
'cause he won right after.

459
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,547
He totally totaled his car,

460
00:33:57,548 --> 00:33:59,695
got it

461
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,914
"A creator who hates
his own creation.

462
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:15,415
Retrace your steps, escape your past."

463
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,155
"A creator who hates
his own creation.

464
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:22,586
"A hidden key, a leap not taken.
Retrace your steps, escape your past.

465
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,063
"And the key of jade
will be yours at last."

466
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,874
"Escape your past."

467
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,513
What part of your past are you
trying to escape?

469
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,101
You're, like,
totally my hero!

470
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,256
Over here!

471
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,398
Dude, you're amazing!

472
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,469
Right here!
Let me get an autograph!

473
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,308
Watch it!



479
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,458
Oh, God.

480
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:19,109
Ugh.

481
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,744
Oh, God. Don't you get it?

483
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,882
have a disguise.

484
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,792
Okay, here.

485
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,722
Clark Kent glasses.

486
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,033
They hide your identity
without changing your look.



489
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,575
The way your inventory
bursts out when you die.

490
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,251
They didn't want
any more blood.

491
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,892
This is right before
the OASIS went live.

492
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:06,487
Six days prior.
December 2nd, 2025.

493
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,525
Check this out.

494
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,156
You know who that is?

496
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,498
started as an intern.

497
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,934
He claims he learned
at the feet of the master.

500
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:24,540
But ask Ogden?

503
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,881
You could have, like,
different tiers of accounts,

504
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,517
like a gold member.

505
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,188
A person could be
silver, platinum, bronze.

506
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,257
You know, depending on
what they paid.

507
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,128
You know, highest one maybe being
"Water" because "OASIS," right?

508
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:45,057
Hell of a latte.

509
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,132
Can you fast-forward to the
stuff about date?

510
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,971
What? actually went
on a date?

514
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:04,321
Kira, The Dark Crystal.

515
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:06,145
That's her gamer tag.

516
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,386
- Karen.
- Karen.

517
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,717
Yeah, okay? Karen Underwood.

518
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:15,332
No, no. Karen Underwood,
as in?

520
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:21,098
What'd you do?



529
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,961
Just once, years before they
were even married, but yeah.

530
00:38:46,962 --> 00:38:49,326
And despite that,
and the fact that she died,

531
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,627
is only mentioned once in all of Journals.

533
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,865
It is. Look it up.

534
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,296
What we just saw is the only
time she's ever mentioned.

536
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,174
She was an important part
of both their lives.



540
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:15,185
That's her gamer tag.

541
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,886
purposely removed every
mention of her except for this one.


543
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,088
It's like, it was just
so painful for him

544
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:24,655
to have to see her face
or hear her name.

545
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,529
Well, he loved her.

546
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,398
He couldn't tell that to.

547
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,069
Oh, that's sad.
He should have told her how he felt.

548
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,567
Yeah, well,
he missed his chance.

549
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,699
Look.

550
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,914
I found the clue to the race
in the other scene, but...

551
00:39:36,915 --> 00:39:38,507
I've always felt
that the biggest clue

552
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,379
to the contest
was hidden here.

555
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,016
Don't sweat it, Curator.

556
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,517
the Rosebud at the center of his story.

564
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,047
You know The Distracted Globe?

570
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,263
And I was starting to.

576
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,646
No. Have you considered that
could be using you?

577
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:54,117
Hey, dude, she's giving me a clue.
Maybe I'm the one using her.

578
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,718
Should I go more Thriller?

580
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,990
Punk?

582
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,464
Duran Duran.

584
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,468
Does it look like
I'm trying too hard?

586
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,604
You have a massive cyber crush
on this girl.

587
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,475
She's hacking your heart
to get to your head.

588
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,846
I got it!

589
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,009
- Buckaroo Banzai?

590
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,284
Really? You're gonna wear the
outfit from your favorite movie?

593
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,458
Z, you gotta be more careful
about who you meet in the OASIS.

594
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:35,756
gets me.
She'll get my outfit.

595
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,759
There's just this connection.
I mean, sometimes, we even...



603
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,715
who lives in his mama's
basement in suburban Detroit.

604
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,615
Chuck.

608
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,490
Come here, man.
Hey, can we get a photo?

609
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,832
- Thank you so much!
- Dude, you're my hero!

621
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,245
What a freak!
I thought he was kind of cute.

625
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,329
Are you gonna kill their avatars?
Zero them out?

626
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,455
They're both here
at The Distracted Globe.

628
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,830
The Distracted Globe
was one of the first clubs

631
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,936
But I double-checked

634
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,759
Right, and she was
a serious dancer.

635
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,846
Maybe he thought
he'd take her here,

637
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,581
As if that ever works.

639
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,424
But they never made it
past the first date.

641
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,187
Who hates his own creation.

642
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,588
And the club
is the thing he hates.

643
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,890
And "A hidden key,
a leap not taken"?




650
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,984
We're not clanning up
or anything.

660
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,249
What kind of haptics
you rockin'?

661
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,750
You got the gloves and full visor,
or a full body?

664
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,100
I got the X1 haptic bootsuit with
the microfiber crotch inlay.

665
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,348
My,
you did come prepared.

667
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,885
Maybe it'd be cool if we
met up in the real world.

668
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,994
No, you'd be disappointed.

672
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:46,166

or my real face.

679
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,157
Are you crazy?
You don't tell anyone who you are.

687
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,192
It's an ambush.

689
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,203
Did you hear what I said?
I said I'm in love with you.

694
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,457
Watch out!

695
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,138
Pull.

696
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,915
Head back!



698
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,428
Zemeckis Cube.

703
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,789
I'm doing this to stop IOI.

704
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,290
I'm talking about
real-world consequences.

705
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,892
People suffering.

706
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,282
- Actual life-and-death stuff.

708
00:49:30,673 --> 00:49:33,836
- He borrowed gear.
- He built up debt.

709
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:37,337
He moved in with the promise of
working it off, but he never did.

710
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,241
IOI just raised
his living expenses,

711
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,812
then he got sick,
and he couldn't afford to get out.

721
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,708
which, if we're offering
constructive criticism,

722
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:19,548
was a lame idea and only
would've slowed him down.

723
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:23,889
Whereas my plan, which was cool
because I rock, actually worked.

724
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,654
He's still on the board.

725
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:29,185
But he won't be for long.

726
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,160
I did a search
for all the Wades

727
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,361
who had recently bought
an X1 bootsuit,

728
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,573
cross-referenced that with public records,
and voila,

729
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:40,636
which is French for...
"And then I found out."

733
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,148
Are you loyal, Ms. Zandor?

735
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:57,486
Well, when you're at war,

736
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,517
you need people
who are loyal to a fault.

737
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,391
People you can count on
to get things done.

738
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,061
I just get people arrested
for not paying their bills.

739
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,002
Yeah, 'cause there are some problems
that require a physical solution,

740
00:51:08,003 --> 00:51:10,568
but there are other times,
particularly at war,

741
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:12,267
when you need
a different set of rules.

746
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,952
So, this is one of those conversations
that we're not really having.

747
00:51:24,953 --> 00:51:26,718
Well, we've had these kind
of conversations before,

748
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,446
and look where you are now.

749
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,752
You got a seat on the board,
head of your own division,



752
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:41,601
The only question is,
how far are we willing to go to win it?

756
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,464
IOI Plaza.
You're a hologram in the real world.

757
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,991
That's a really cool rig.

758
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:20,032
Thank you.
It's a brand-new Habashaw, OIR 9400.

760
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:26,802
You know, if you came to work at IOI,
you'd get one of these.

762
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,968
You'd also get your own
penthouse apartment in Columbus

765
00:53:38,654 --> 00:53:40,516
You want the ship
from Defender?

766
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:43,247
You know, the kind that can
just jump into hyperspace?

767
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,163
You want
the Millennium Falcon?

772
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:58,541
And if you do happen to find that Easter egg,
there's a bonus.

774
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:09,779
I can see you're using
emotion-suppressing software right now,

775
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,679
and why wouldn't you?
It's smart, not to show your hand.

778
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,239
Well, I don't know about that.
What, for the OASIS?

779
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,435
I guess if you're not
a John Hughes fan...

782
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:44,363
is convert all the schools
on Ludus to replicas

783
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,818
from The Breakfast Club
and Ferris Bueller.

784
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:50,986
No way. That's a great idea.

785
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,455
Ridgemont or Faber?

786
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,556
Fast Times at Ridgemont High,
not John Hughes.

787
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,799
Faber College from Animal House.

788
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,426
John Hughes didn't direct

789
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,431
Fast Times at Ridgemont High
or Animal House.

790
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:07,774
Ferris Bueller and The Breakfast Club,
they went to Shermer High School,

791
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,311
which is in Shermer, Illinois.
I know what you think.

792
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:13,008
You think
I'm a corporate asshole,

794
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:19,523
Man, that's not true.
You know, when I wanna blow off steam...

795
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:23,486
Drink Tab, play Robotron,
listen to Duran Duran.

796
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,086
I crack open a Tab.

797
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,488
I put on some Duran Duran.
I play Robotron.

809
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:16,340
It just seems like he
wouldn't want you winning it.

810
00:56:16,341 --> 00:56:18,339
A fanboy knows a hater,

811
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,411
and I know you've got a whole
department of oologists in your ear.

815
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:32,687
Your board of directors,
you got them in the other ear?

816
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,619
Why don't you tell 'em this.

817
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,559
If they dump you,
I'll consider it.

824
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:58,045
Wow, you really
switched gears there.

825
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:01,117
From fairly reasonable
to maniacal overlord.

826
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:04,117
You should be grateful

827
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,560
You won't be around
to endure my maniacal reign.

830
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:18,597
I also know where you are.
Unit 56K, Columbus stacks.

831
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,371
You were last seen entering
your trailer three days ago.

837
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:31,205
in some ghetto trash
rat warren in Columbus?

843
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,829
This bootsuit's pretty awesome.
Thanks for that.

844
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,928
Rick! Rick, the place
is gonna blow!

846
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:24,632
- Put Alice on!
- Let me talk to him.

850
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:14,515
IOI came for me
in the real world.

851
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:17,317
They gotta be coming after you,
so wherever you are...

852
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,496
Sorry about the blindfold.

853
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:47,615
paranoid.

858
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:05,772
Showers are that way,
clean clothes, too.

859
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:13,108
Welcome to the rebellion,

861
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,629
We've been living this close
to each other the whole time?

864
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,172
For the record,

869
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,860
I've lived with it my whole life.
You don't have to pretend.


871
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,781
Why would that scare me?

889
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,079
- I just figured it out.
- Figured what out?

891
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,922
We've been thinking about it
too literally.

892
01:02:37,923 --> 01:02:39,454
"The leap not taken,"

893
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,685
the leap didn't take,
is with.

894
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,531
Yeah, but... I mean,
he blamed her for breaking up.

899
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,542
The place where the leap
wasn't taken.

900
01:02:57,543 --> 01:02:59,210
Where the date was.

908
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,104
Okay, so our options for that
week are The Fly remake.

909
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:27,235
Great flick,
terrible date movie.

910
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:30,736
Say Anything...
That would make sense.

911
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:35,180
We gotta remember the clue.

916
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,754
No side chitchat.

919
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,801
Absolutely positive.

920
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:02,642
Let's hope
you have the belly for it.

925
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,855
Yeah, there are so many keys
The Shining, though.

928
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,553
I had

929
01:05:07,554 --> 01:05:11,007
Okay, so we got the key
from room 237,

930
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:12,907
the keys to the Snowcat,

931
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,739
or the keys they give Jack
at the beginning of the movie.

932
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,374
Well,
if it's "the leap not taken,"

933
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:18,005
maybe the key
isn't a key at all.

934
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,084
I know
where the Snowcat keys are!

935
01:05:19,085 --> 01:05:20,281
I say we split up.

936
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,950
We get all the keys

937
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,491
and then we meet back
at the Torrances' apartment.

940
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,364
Little girls, y'all know
how to get out of here?

948
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,373
Oh, uh, hi, naked lady.
I'm sorry.

949
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,484
I didn't mean to interrupt,
uh, your bath time.

950
01:06:53,485 --> 01:06:55,536
Uh, I know self-care
can be important.

951
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:58,714
Uh, but can you do me a favor and tell me,
where are all the exits?

953
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,221
Okay, am I being punked?

954
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,622
'Cause you're likin' me
a little way too much.

955
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,286
All right, you know what?
I'ma go with it.

956
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:26,908
Ahh!

957
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,580
Time's running out.

958
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,715
Yo, Z, is
pissed at me?

959
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:10,116
Dude, I'm pissed at you.
You've never seen The Shining, have you?

960
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,519
You know I hate scary movies!


962
01:08:12,804 --> 01:08:14,088
Sweet!

963
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,630
We ain't got no business
goin' to room 237!

964
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,425
We should stay out!

965
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,057
Plus, there was this crazy,
naked zombie lady in there.

966
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,762
There are no zombies
The Shining.

967
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,734
Well, maybe it's not supposed
to be like the movie.

969
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,644
Hey, y'all.

972
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:44,422
"Escape your past."

973
01:08:44,423 --> 01:08:47,620
"The leap not taken."

974
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,633
greatest fear 
wasn't The Shining

976
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:55,668
His biggest fear
was kissing a girl.

977
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:59,244
That's the leap
he couldn't take.

978
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,875
The ballroom.

980
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,170
Zombies. Told you.

983
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:40,375
None of this
is in The Shining.

984
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,646
Z, look. That's the zombie-circle
level in Mayhem Mansion,

986
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,120
The whole Shining trivia
is just a diversion.

987
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:48,946
One minute left.

988
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,692
How do we get to her?



993
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,915
Care to dance?



996
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:11,302
Jade Key.

997
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,696
Imagine that.

1000
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:01,183
One of our oologists saw them
enter the media library.

1001
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:02,850
She cracked the clue.



1003
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,791
Get her off me!
Get her off me!



1007
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:45,388
I know. I'll get back to you.

1008
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:47,464
I got what you're looking for.

1009
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:55,603
Freeze. This guy.
The one with the lame tattoo.

1010
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:03,082
Run him through our database,
every IOI drone in Columbus.

1012
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,174
Groceries are here.

1013
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,675
All right. Gluten-O's...

1014
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:35,906
"If you know
the answer ultimate,

1015
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,179
"divide it
by the number magic,

1016
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,020
"and what you need, want, and desire
will be found in the fortress tragic."

1017
01:13:41,021 --> 01:13:43,116
"Tragic," that's gotta be 
referring to himself.

1019
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,019
Because he was lonely.

1020
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,921
He had no one to spend his
life with towards the end.

1021
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,024
Yeah, that's true.

1022
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,955
The contest has gotta be somehow
about connecting with someone.

1023
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,528
Anyone.

1024
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,029
He wants the person
who cares for the OASIS

1025
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,730
to be connected
with the world.

1026
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:59,272
That's what I think
he's trying to tell us.



1030
01:14:14,565 --> 01:14:17,917
It's exactly
why I think you'll win.

1031
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,790
Really? You really think
I'm gonna win?

1032
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,461
Do not move!

1033
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,335
Target identified!

1034
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:36,967
Freeze! Don't move!

1035
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,419
- This leads right to the alley.
- You first.

1036
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,145
I'm right behind you. Go now!

1037
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:51,285
Come on!

1038
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:53,786
the OASIS needs you.

1039
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,089
- I'm gonna delay them.
- Wait!

1040
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,525
No, no, no, wait! No, no, no!



1042
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,567
Freeze, freeze, freeze!

1043
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,610
Don't move!

1044
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,546
Samantha Evelyn Cook.

1045
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:24,219
IOI has purchased and consolidated
all of your outstanding debt,

1046
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,488
currently in excess
of 23,000 credits.

1047
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,359
You will be remanded to the
nearest IOI loyalty center

1048
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,859
until your debt
is paid in full,

1049
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,660
including any interest,
processing,

1050
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,331
or late fees
you incur henceforth.

1051
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,572
Does anybody have eyes?
Check down the next street!

1052
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,547
- "First to the key."
- "First to the egg."

1053
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,850
Wait, what?

1054
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,856
"Never trust someone you meet
in the OASIS."

1055
01:15:59,857 --> 01:16:02,857
"She might be a 300-pound dude
named Chuck..."

1056
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:06,128
"Who lives in his mama's
basement in suburban Detroit."

1058
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,935
Helen. My dad called me "H."
It kinda stuck. Let's go!

1059
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,975
That thing's IDing my van.

1060
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,832
Come on. They've spotted us.

1062
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,040
My real name is Toshiro.
Samantha got us a message.

1063
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,866
She told us to meet you here.

1064
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,271
Samantha,
they took her to the...

1065
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,307
The loyalty center, I know.

1066
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,878
Look, in other awesome news,
the Sixers found the third challenge.

1067
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:58,778
- What?
- Just come on, get in!

1070
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:16,395
How did IOI find
the third challenge so fast?

1071
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,498
IOI cracked the first
three lines of the clue,

1072
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,167
so they knew it was sector 14

1073
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:21,768
but they couldn't figure out
"the fortress tragic."

1074
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,170
So they sent every guide
they had into that sector

1075
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,142
until they found
the right fortress.

1078
01:17:30,955 --> 01:17:32,976
His real name is Xo.

1079
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:35,751
But everyone else calls me Sho,
no big deal.

1081
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,090
Sho, you're the world's most
badass 11-year-old ever.

1085
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:51,665
We have to go save Samantha.

1086
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,035
Well, we can't just
go through the doors of IOI.

1087
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:56,266
Look, I've been thinkin' about it.
I got a better plan.

1088
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,271
rig

1090
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,805
Let's go after the man himself and
make him give back to us.

1091
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:04,711
But first,
I have to know exactly,

1092
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:06,723
how much about rig 
do you remember?



1094
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:28,042
Maintenance,
report to loyalty pod 31-B.

1095
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:36,714
Security, please report
to section 97 for escort.

1096
01:18:57,432 --> 01:19:00,302
Newbie

1099
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,850
Lay those charges
every six feet.

1100
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:25,028
Keep it moving!

1101
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,364
Hey, you!

1102
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,304
Those are explosives!

1103
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:36,244
IOI will not reimburse
any lost coin if you zero out.

1104
01:19:36,245 --> 01:19:38,038
Keep it moving!

1105
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,784
So what is this challenge,
some sort of video game thing?

1106
01:19:45,785 --> 01:19:47,881
An Atari 2600, sir.

1107
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:51,493
And every game ever made for it,
thousands of possibilities.

1108
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:53,624
Come up!

1110
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,495
this is how
you plan to resolve

1111
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:04,926
the fate of the world's most
important economic resource?

1114
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,942
One minute into Centipede,
the ice broke.

1115
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:16,010
It has to be Joust!

1116
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:18,951
still holds the world record
on the 2600 port of that game.

1117
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:20,947
Maybe we just need
to beat his high score.

1118
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:23,249
Pitfall! One of the only 2600
games that still hasn't ended.

1119
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:24,691
And how about
those Swordquest games?

1120
01:20:24,692 --> 01:20:26,586
Yes!
The Swordquest games.

1121
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,658
They were created for a contest
Atari held with real...

1122
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,331
how are we doin'?

1123
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,604
To be honest, I think I need
physical therapy because it's not...

1125
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,336
Um, as you wish.

1128
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,049
Ah...

1129
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,117
How does it work?

1130
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:00,558
Has it got, like,
a remote or is there a button or something?

1131
01:21:00,559 --> 01:21:04,185
it's a level-99 magic artifact,

1132
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:08,002
not one of your drones,
so it is activated by a magic spell.

1133
01:21:08,003 --> 01:21:10,096
Would you care
to do the honors?

1142
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:26,641
That was a corporate decision.
It was not personal.

1146
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:36,118
You're gonna tell me
exactly which rig she's in

1148
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:41,864
Yeah, that seems appropriate.

1151
01:22:49,696 --> 01:22:51,495
Where's the rig?


1153
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,579
We're in his account.
1157
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,595
We grabbed him in transit just as
he was logging out of the OASIS,

1160
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:30,004
So, you basically
just remotely hacked his rig.

1161
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:33,035
A fixed rig is easy to locate, hard to hack.

1162
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,781
Unless he's stupid enough to
leave his password lying around.

1163
01:23:35,782 --> 01:23:37,177
Loyalty center, I'm in.


1167
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,625
I'm tapped directly
into your audio feed.

1169
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,467
We got his password, 
hacked rig.

1173
01:24:06,976 --> 01:24:08,505
And there's more,
they just put a force field

1174
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:10,380
around Castle.

1175
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,368
I heard one of the guards calling it

1176
01:24:17,369 --> 01:24:19,989
and the only way to take it
down is from the inside.

1177
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:23,157
She's right.
Level-99 artifact,

1178
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:26,088
creates a magic-resistant,
impenetrable barrier.

1179
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,828
No way through it.

1182
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,071
All right, so I'm looking
at a diagram of your rig.

1189
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:00,094
Okay, inside the panel,
there's a lever.

1190
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:02,455
Grab it with your right hand
and slide it to the left.

1191
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:03,974
That should release you.

1192
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,979
It worked. It worked, I'm out.

1193
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,105
Loyalty pod 41-F,

1194
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,111
you are on an authorized
break for 10 minutes.

1195
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:27,555
Pod 41-F, you are
on 10-minute break.

1196
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:29,715
Proceed to break area.

1200
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:37,173
It's in the IOI war room,
two levels above where you are now.

1206
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:50,907
You need to raise an army.

1210
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:58,447
I'm gonna take down
that shield.

1211
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,193
Wait, Arty, wait!
You gotta get out of there!

1217
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,869
This isn't real,
you're tapping my feed.

1219
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:07,159
they've hacked my rig.
They're after the girl.

1221
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:26,537
Pod 41-F,
you have exceeded your break time.

1222
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:30,311
Report to security

1223
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:44,030
So, she just walks out of here,
how does that happen?

1224
01:27:44,031 --> 01:27:46,285
They're smart. They knew
what they were doing.

1225
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:49,134
But we know they're in Columbus.
And now, all five of them are together.

1226
01:27:49,135 --> 01:27:51,630
Wait. Wait, we know what?
How do we know?

1227
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:55,403
We have the make and model of the van.
We'll spot them.

1228
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:57,537
"We'll spot them"?

1229
01:27:57,538 --> 01:28:00,778
That sounds like a great
inscription for our tombstones.

1230
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:02,305
Why didn't you tell me
this earlier?

1231
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,910
It wasn't relevant yet.

1233
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:06,713
We need to know.
We need to find them!

1234
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:09,750
They're kids,
Man the hell up!

1235
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:12,951
Do your job, and I'll do mine,
unless you wanna take this

1236
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,024
and go after them yourself.

1238
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:34,484
The Complete Nancy Drew,
Kegel Exercises for...

1239
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,807
Bingo. Okay.

1240
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:41,083
"Congratulations,
you are the proud owner,

1241
01:28:41,084 --> 01:28:43,016
"a 99th level magic artifact.

1242
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:45,847
"Read these instructions before deploying.
To turn orb on, off."

1243
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:47,354
Off! Yes, off.

1244
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,685
"Utter spell
within 10 feet of orb."

1247
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:11,683
I'm here talking to all of you now
because our future's being threatened

1248
01:29:11,684 --> 01:29:15,779
by people who will stop at
nothing to win this contest.

1249
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,818
Some of you already know this,

1250
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:21,789
and you've lost much more than
just your avatars or your weapons.



1254
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:40,481
I only came here to escape the
shitty hand that life dealt me.

1257
01:29:48,355 --> 01:29:50,219
I found a cause.

1259
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:58,089
And yes, I know
it's kind of a groaner, but...

1261
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,864
And I don't wanna lose that

1262
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:06,525
to this colossal douchebag,

1264
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:15,008
He thinks that we're all too
distracted to even notice...

1265
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:19,779
put up a fight.

1267
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:22,848
This is going out live!

1268
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:24,950
The only thing 
let this guy do...

1269
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:26,622

- ...was get him a cup of coffee.

1270
01:30:26,623 --> 01:30:27,521
And now, we're supposed
to hand him the OASIS?

1271
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,196
Oh, man.

1272
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:44,736
Come on, come on.
Give me this thing.

1274
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:48,708
Left arm.

1275
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:51,209
- Left arm!
- Sir.

1276
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:53,212
No, I need the left arm.

1277
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:55,554
No, I don't care if...
I want it on.

1278
01:30:57,385 --> 01:31:00,145
He thinks that we won't
even put up a fight!

1280
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:06,757
gunter 
clans in the gold mines of Gygax.

1281
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:10,001
Activate the Iron Giant.



1288
01:31:53,873 --> 01:31:57,208
In the name of James himself,

1292
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:34,712
Squadron 14, armor up,
you're in the lead.

1293
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:51,988
One minute into Swordquest,
the ice broke.

1294
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:55,763
Well, all three Swordquests.

1295
01:33:55,764 --> 01:33:57,603
Dark Cavern, Laser Blast.

1296
01:33:57,604 --> 01:33:58,828
It's Adventure.

1297
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,101
Released in 1979,
for the 2600,

1298
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:03,169
Adventure was created by
Warren Robinett,

1299
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:05,340
who was the first video game designer
ever to hide his name. In fact...

1305
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,653
I'd say about ten...

1306
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:30,024
Yeah, about 10 million years,
so we should be fine.

1313
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:17,966
The Sixers are in the final challenge.
It's an Atari 2600.


1315
01:37:20,201 --> 01:37:21,801
No, no, no.
You gotta get out of there.

1318
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,307
Created!

1319
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:29,839
He was the first designer to
ever hide an Easter egg in...


1321
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:38,723
We're looking for a USPS truck,
Ohio plates,

1322
01:37:38,724 --> 01:37:41,789
a drone spitter, 2036 model.

1323
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:03,707
When are you
getting into this fight?

1324
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:18,888
I'm out. Inventory's empty.

1325
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,076
Last clip for me.

1327
01:38:21,262 --> 01:38:25,432
Anti-personnel
ordinance cannon!

1328
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:31,065
Railgun!



1333
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,627
fucking Chucky!

1336
01:39:58,258 --> 01:39:59,828
Mechagodzilla!

1338
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:26,691
Get to the bridge.
Go now, he's distracted.

1344
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:49,197
He's only got 30 seconds





1353
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:35,343
Hang on!

1355
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:20,679
we've got this.
You need to log out.

1356
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:23,451
If the game is Adventure,
why haven't they won yet?






1370
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:16,036
Get it together, Sixer.
Back to respawn.



1373
01:46:36,857 --> 01:46:39,487
Holy hand grenade!
How much did that cost?

1374
01:46:39,493 --> 01:46:42,003
Less than
it's gonna cost them.


1376
01:46:54,941 --> 01:46:57,681
Sir, the gunters
are approaching the challenge.




1387
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:45,289
Remember 
announcement.

1388
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,732
The keys are invisible,
and they're hidden in a dark room

1389
01:47:47,733 --> 01:47:50,296
that's at the center
of a maze.

1390
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:53,967
Well, there's a secret in Adventure,
and you don't find it by winning.

1391
01:47:53,968 --> 01:47:56,897
You find it by wandering
around in a dark room.

1392
01:47:56,903 --> 01:47:58,604
Until you get
to the invisible dot.

1393
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:00,305
It's pretty easy
if you know what you're doing.



1395
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,846
Let me finish it for you.

1399
01:48:18,694 --> 01:48:20,532
Why the hell
would I ever do that?

1400
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:24,179
Dude!
That's the Cataclyst.



1402
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:27,829
I'd just as soon never set
foot in the OASIS again,

1403
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:30,002
let alone have to deal
with any of this absurdity.

1404
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:35,207
But I know how important 
competition is to you, so...


1406
01:48:39,649 --> 01:48:43,676
Well, that's fine.
Three easy steps. One.

1407
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:46,153
Wait, I thought you were bluffing.
You know that kills all of us, right?

1408
01:48:46,154 --> 01:48:48,222
I've got 10 years' worth
of shit inside of me.

1410
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:51,290
I'm not goin' out like that.

1411
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:52,825
That's a camper move.

1412
01:48:52,826 --> 01:48:53,956
You don't even know
how to activate an orb.



1415
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:15,981
Hadouken!







1425
01:51:29,949 --> 01:51:32,549
Live feed
in all OASIS channels.

1426
01:51:32,552 --> 01:51:35,162
's letting everyone
watch the end of the contest.

1428
01:51:36,523 --> 01:51:38,793
God damn it,
we tried Adventure.

1429
01:51:38,794 --> 01:51:40,359
No, we tried to win it.

1430
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,828
But the hidden room isn't
at the end of the game.

1431
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:45,399
You've gotta go straight to the
invisible dot at the start.



1433
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:04,380
doesn't know what planet she's on?


1435
01:52:17,263 --> 01:52:20,073
Toshiro.


1438
01:52:30,176 --> 01:52:34,346
Yeah, I know. Not what
you were expecting, 

1439
01:52:34,347 --> 01:52:38,947
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
a late '30s-model postal van.

1441
01:52:43,123 --> 01:52:45,093
Wait, I thought the Cataclyst went off.
How are you still playing?

1446
01:52:57,241 --> 01:52:59,567
Ninjas



1451
01:53:34,674 --> 01:53:37,244
I've got a drone on their tail.
I'm close.

1452
01:53:37,245 --> 01:53:38,510
Send me coordinates.

1453
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:40,751
Maybe you should
leave this to me,

1457
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,596
What's goin' on out there?

1458
01:54:08,942 --> 01:54:11,442
- The game is over for them.
- What are they watching?



1462
01:54:22,839 --> 01:54:25,724
He wanted people to know
who was behind it.

1463
01:54:25,725 --> 01:54:28,455
That's why he created
the first digital Easter egg

1464
01:54:28,461 --> 01:54:31,161
and to find it,
you didn't even have to win.

1465
01:54:31,164 --> 01:54:35,344
You just had to blindly play,
searching around

1466
01:54:35,345 --> 01:54:39,465
in rooms for an invisible dot.

1467
01:54:39,472 --> 01:54:42,040
You took the dot
back to the main screen

1468
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:46,681
and that's when you found the first
Easter egg ever put in a video game.

1469
01:54:46,682 --> 01:54:47,979
The creator's name.

1470
01:55:12,605 --> 01:55:14,705
What's going on, man?
I can't see shit.

1471
01:55:14,707 --> 01:55:16,137
just got the Crystal Key!



1473
01:55:36,429 --> 01:55:38,529
what the hell's going on?

1474
01:55:38,531 --> 01:55:40,531
Just practicing Mario Kart.
What do you think?

1475
01:55:40,533 --> 01:55:42,643
IOI's trying to kill us, man!

1476
01:55:56,816 --> 01:55:59,146
Everyone watching,
if you're in the Columbus stacks,

1478
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:03,420
real-world,
and we're gonna need your help.

1479
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:04,993
head for the stacks!

1480
01:56:04,994 --> 01:56:07,261
Okay, hold on!

1481
01:56:31,918 --> 01:56:33,918
Stick the key in,
how hard is it?


1486
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:14,856
Now, you just sign these papers,
and the OASIS is yours.

1487
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:19,171
You will be
its sole proprietor.

1488
01:57:19,172 --> 01:57:20,695
That ain't so bad, is it?

1489
01:57:42,488 --> 01:57:43,588
I'm gonna need a second.

1493
01:58:22,731 --> 01:58:25,297
sign over his shares 
in Gregarious.



1501
01:59:11,777 --> 01:59:14,047
This is where you grew up.

1502
01:59:23,256 --> 01:59:26,186
Oh, that's just me
a long time ago.

1503
01:59:26,192 --> 01:59:29,802
I like to have him around
from time to time.

1504
01:59:29,803 --> 01:59:32,095
Hey, I have
to show you something.

1505
01:59:32,098 --> 01:59:33,798
This, uh... Come on.

1506
01:59:33,799 --> 01:59:35,634
This is the button.

1507
01:59:35,635 --> 01:59:38,935
If you push it,
the whole simulation shuts down

1508
01:59:38,938 --> 01:59:42,538
and a tapeworm program will
erase all of the backup servers.

1509
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:46,312
So you now have the power
to turn the OASIS off forever.

1510
01:59:46,313 --> 01:59:47,952
Do you understand?

1511
01:59:53,319 --> 01:59:54,486
Yeah,

1512
01:59:54,487 --> 01:59:56,454
try not to accidentally erase

1513
01:59:56,455 --> 01:59:59,185
the whole of the OASIS
on your first day.

1514
02:00:08,501 --> 02:00:10,271
The stacks are straight ahead!

1515
02:00:26,018 --> 02:00:28,987
Well, I expect you have to go.
I know I do.

1516
02:00:28,988 --> 02:00:31,518
So, now is the time for you
to receive your prize

1517
02:00:31,524 --> 02:00:34,059
because you won
all three keys.

1518
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:38,760
Once you take this egg,
the game will be over.

1519
02:00:38,764 --> 02:00:41,904
The egg, the egg...

1520
02:00:49,275 --> 02:00:51,705
We know what you did here.

1521
02:00:51,711 --> 02:00:55,081
You turn around and walk out
of here while you still can.

1522
02:01:07,627 --> 02:01:10,195
I created the OASIS

1523
02:01:10,196 --> 02:01:14,926
because I never felt at home
in the real world.

1524
02:01:14,934 --> 02:01:19,414
I just didn't know how to
connect with the people there.

1525
02:01:19,415 --> 02:01:22,905
I was afraid
for all of my life.

1526
02:01:22,908 --> 02:01:25,708
Right up until the day
I knew my life was ending.

1527
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:36,371
Now, that... That was when
I realized that,

1528
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:41,459
as terrifying and painful
as reality can be,

1529
02:01:42,261 --> 02:01:46,331
it's also the only place




1538
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:30,441
Hooray.

1540
02:03:06,746 --> 02:03:08,076
Hold it!

1542
02:03:13,853 --> 02:03:16,593
Hands on your head.

1545
02:03:39,114 --> 02:03:41,911
You're not an avatar, are you?


1556
02:04:45,945 --> 02:04:48,905
Now, there are some people out here
that would very much like to meet you.

1557
02:04:48,914 --> 02:04:52,150
Wow, this is incredible.

1558
02:04:52,151 --> 02:04:54,991
It's an honor to meet you,
Og, but I...

1563
02:05:31,857 --> 02:05:34,127
We need you to make a statement
about the clip you sent in

1564
02:05:34,128 --> 02:05:36,326
confession.


1566
02:05:39,064 --> 02:05:41,704
What? I record everything
in my workshop.


1568
02:05:56,248 --> 02:05:58,548
Who are you guys?

1569
02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:02,921
The people you need right now, lawyers.
From Gregarious Games.

1571
02:06:15,267 --> 02:06:17,336
I'm splitting it with my clan.

1572
02:06:17,337 --> 02:06:19,406
We're gonna
run things together.

1576
02:07:09,054 --> 02:07:10,555
how'd you get here so fast?

1577
02:07:10,556 --> 02:07:13,256
I flew from the stars
on my magic sleigh.

1578
02:07:13,258 --> 02:07:15,827
Everyone's been watching.

1579
02:07:15,828 --> 02:07:19,128
Of course, I've been watching
a little closer than most.

1583
02:07:33,445 --> 02:07:35,475
Jim told me nothing
about the contest,

1584
02:07:35,481 --> 02:07:38,851
so there was no rule about me
losing a bet to a smart kid.

1585
02:07:38,852 --> 02:07:41,486
Not that you needed my help.

1586
02:07:41,487 --> 02:07:45,817
You figured out that 
on your own.

1589
02:07:53,799 --> 02:07:55,629
You were the Rosebud.



1595
02:08:16,689 --> 02:08:19,357
Oh. Well, look who it is.

1596
02:08:19,358 --> 02:08:21,125
It's my heroes, the High Five.

1599
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:26,630
and the first thing we did

1600
02:08:26,632 --> 02:08:29,872
was sign to 
a non-exclusive consultancy.

1601
02:08:29,873 --> 02:08:32,868
The salary, per his demand,

1602
02:08:32,871 --> 02:08:36,141
was 25 cents. One quarter.

1603
02:08:39,344 --> 02:08:42,280
With his guidance,
our second move was to ban

1604
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:45,498
any loyalty centers
from accessing the OASIS.



1606
02:08:51,423 --> 02:08:54,425
The third thing we did
wasn't as popular.


1608
02:08:58,430 --> 02:09:00,930
I know, it sounds
like a weird move,

1609
02:09:00,933 --> 02:09:03,903
but people need to spend
more time in the real world.
